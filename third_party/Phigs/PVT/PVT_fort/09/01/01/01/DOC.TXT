TITLE: Operating state errors handled by user

MODULE#: 09.01.01.01

DESCRIPTION: This module tests that the functions which require a
certain set of operating states generate the specified error codes if
they are executed in an incorrect state.  The error is handled by a
user defined error handling subroutine.  Also, this module tests the
requirement that no side effects are generated.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.  If function <open phigs> is called, and the state is not
(PHCL,WSCL,STCL,ARCL), then error 1 is generated and the function is
ignored.
#F 1
#D 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 8.1
#S 4.12/109/6
#T P01/1 P01/2

SR2.  If functions <open workstation>, <set edit mode>, <empty
structure>-<change structure identifier and references>, <open archive
file>, <set conflict resolution>, <interpret item>, <set error
handling mode>, <escape> are called, and the state is not
(PHOP,*,*,*), then error 2 is generated and the function is ignored.
#F 3 117 125-131 135 140 199 318 319

SR3.  If functions <close workstation>-<message>, <set polyline
representaion>-<set color model>, <set hlhsr mode>, <set view
representation 3>-<set workstation viewport>, <post structure>-<unpost
sll structures>, <set pick filter>-<read item from metafile> are
called, and the state is not (PHOP,WSOP,*,*), then error 3 or 54 is
generated and the function is ignored.

ignored.

identifier>, <set local transformation 3>-<set view index>, <close
structure>-<generalized strcture element>, <copy all elements from
structure>-<delete elements between labels>, <set pick identifier> are
called, and the state is not (PHOP,*,STOP,*), then error 5 is
generated and the function is ignored.

PROGRAM 1: Error 1 handled by user

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: This is a passive test, but take care to invoke it so
as to link in the standard PVT user-defined error handler.  Since this
is the mode in which the non-error-handling tests are executed, this
program should be invoked in the normal way.

DESIGN:

Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted
by the tag "signals error"), the user-defined error handler saves
the error code, function identifier, and error file identifier in
an error table.

*** *** ***  Generate errors; test absence of side effects  *** *** ***

<open phigs>: signals error
TEST: #SR 1
      "If <open phigs> signals an error because PHIGS is open, it
       should not cause any other effect."
pass/fail depending on (system state = PHIGS-open)

*** *** ***  Results of user-defined error handling  *** *** ***

TEST: #SR 1
      "If <open phigs> is called and PHIGS is open, it should
       return error code  001, function identifier  000, and the current

pass/fail depending on (next entry in error table = expected values)

PROGRAM 2: Error 2 handled by user

CHARACTERISTICS: ynnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: See OPERATOR SCRIPT for Program 1.

DESIGN:

Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted
by the tag "signals error"), the user-defined error handler saves the
error code, function identifier, and error file identifier in an error
table.  Since PHIGS is closed, the error file identifier is not checked.

Close phigs after initializing to test if functions 2, 96, 104,
106, 110, 114, 119 generates error 2: ignoring function, function
requires state (PHOP,*,*,*).

PROGRAM 3: Error 3 handled by user

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: See OPERATOR SCRIPT for Program 1.

DESIGN:

Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted
by the tag "signals error"), the user-defined error handler saves the
error code, function identifier, and error file identifier in an
error table. When phigs is closed, the error file identifier is not
checked.

close workstation after initializing to test if functions
3,4,5,63,65,70,73,86,88,112 generate error 3 and/or 54; then close
phigs to test if functions 3,4,5,6,62,66,69,71,84,87,89,111,113
generate error 3 and/or 54: ignoring function, function requires
state (PHOP,WSOP,*,*).

PROGRAM 4: Error 4 handled by user

CHARACTERISTICS: ynnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: See OPERATOR SCRIPT for Program 1.

DESIGN:

Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted by
the tag "signals error"), the user-defined error handler saves the error
code, function identifier, and error file identifier in an error table.
When phigs is closed, the error file identifier is not checked.

Open workstation, open structure or open archive file after
initializing to test if function <close phigs> generates error 4;
then close phigs to test if <close phigs> generates error 4:
ignoring function, function requires state (PHOP, WSCL, STCL,
ARCL).

PROGRAM 6: Error 6 handled by user

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: See OPERATOR SCRIPT for Program 1.

DESIGN:

Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted by
the tag "signals error"), the user-defined error handler saves the error
code, function identifier, and error file identifier in an error table.
When phigs is closed, the error file identifier is not checked.

Open structure after initializing to test if <open structure>
generates error 6; then close phigs to test if <open structure>
generates error 6: ignoring function, function requires state
(PHOP, *, STCL, *).

PROGRAM 7: Error 7 handled by user

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: See OPERATOR SCRIPT for Program 1.

DESIGN:

Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted by
the tag "signals error"), the user-defined error handler saves the error
code, function identifier, and error file identifier in an error table.
When phigs is closed, the error file identifier is not checked.

Not open archive file after initializing to test if function
115,116, 120,121,123,124,126 generates error 7 and/or 404; close
phigs to test if those functions generate error 7 and/or 404:
ignoring function, function requires state (PHOP, *, *, AROP).
