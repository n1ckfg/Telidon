TITLE: Operating state error indicators

MODULE#: 09.02.01

DESCRIPTION: This module tests that the functions which require a set of
operating states set the specified state error to the error indicator if
they are executed in an incorrect state.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.  If functions <translate 3>-<evaluate view mapping matrix>,
<inquire list of available workstation types>-<inquire conflict
resolution>, <inquire more simultaneous events>, <inquire workstation
category>-<inquire open structure>, <inquire element type and
size>-<incremental spatial search>, <inquire error handling mode> are
called, and the state is not (PHOP, *,*,*), then the error indicator
is set to 2.

SR2.  If functions <inquire workstation connection and type>-<inquire
string device state>, <inquire input queue overflow> are called, and
the state is not (PHOP, WSOP, *, *), then the error indicator is set
to 3.
