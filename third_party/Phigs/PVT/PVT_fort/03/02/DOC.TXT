TITLE: Conflict resolution flags


MODULE#: 03.02


DESCRIPTION: This module tests the behavior of the <set conflict
resolution> and <inquire conflict resolution> functions.


SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.  Immediately after <open phigs>, the archival conflict
resolution flag is UPDATE and the retrieval conflict resolution
flag is ABANDON.
#F 1 212
#D 4.7 4.8
#S 6.5/314/1
#T P01/1 P01/3

SR2.  <Set conflict resolution> individually sets the conflict
resolution flags to MAINTAIN, ABANDON, or UPDATE.
#F 140
#D 4.7 4.8
#S 4.4.7/32/7 6.5/314/1
#T P01/2

SR3.  <Inquire conflict resolution> returns the current value of
the conflict resolution flags.
#F 212
#D 4.7 4.8

PROGRAM 1: Setting and inquiring conflict resolution flags

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: passive test.

DESIGN:

Throughout, use variable names:
arcrst : archival conflict resolution flag, as set
recrst : retrieval conflict resolution flag, as set
arcriq : archival conflict resolution flag, as inquired
recriq : retrieval conflict resolution flag, as inquired

<open phigs>

TEST: #SR 1 3
      "Immediately after <open phigs>, the archival conflict
       resolution flag should be reported as UPDATE and the
       retrieval conflict resolution flag should be reported as
       ABANDON."
<inquire conflict resolution>  to determine:
   arcriq = current archival conflict resolution flag
   recriq = current retrieval conflict resolution flag
pass/fail depending on (arcriq = UPDATE and recriq = ABANDON)


TEST: #SR 2 3
      "It should be possible to set and inquire the conflict
       resolution flags to all combinations of valid values:
       MAINTAIN, ABANDON, and UPDATE."

do arcrst = MAINTAIN, ABANDON, UPDATE
   do recrst = MAINTAIN, ABANDON, UPDATE
      <set conflict resolution> with arcrst, recrst
      <inquire conflict resolution> to determine:
         arcriq = current archival conflict resolution flag
         recriq = current retrieval conflict resolution flag
      if (arcrst = arcriq and recrst = recriq) then
         OK so far
      else
         informative message about failure:
            arcrst, recrst, arcriq, recriq
         fail
         goto end_set_loop
      endif
   loop
loop
pass
end_set_loop:

<set conflict resolution> with MAINTAIN, MAINTAIN

<close phigs>

<open phigs>

TEST: #SR 1 3
      "Immediately after re-opening phigs, the archival conflict
       resolution flag should be reported as UPDATE and the
       retrieval conflict resolution flag should be reported as
       ABANDON."
<inquire conflict resolution>  to determine:
   arcriq = current archival conflict resolution flag
   recriq = current retrieval conflict resolution flag
pass/fail depending on (arcriq = UPDATE and recriq = ABANDON)

<close phigs>
