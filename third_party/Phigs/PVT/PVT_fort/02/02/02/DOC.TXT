CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: passive test.

DESIGN:

Use <inquire current element type and size> thoughout to determine:
    celtyp = current element type
    celsiz = current element size

Use <inquire current element content> throughout to determine:
    celcon = current element content

TEST: #SR 1 2
      "<Inquire current element type and size> should return
       label as the type of the created element and the
       appropriate element size."
<inquire current element type and size> to set celtyp, celsiz
pass/fail depending on
