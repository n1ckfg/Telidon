TITLE: Global structure deletion

MODULE#: 02.01.02.03

DESCRIPTION: This module tests the global deletion of structures using
<delete all structures>.


SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.   <Delete all structures> removes all closed structures from the CSS.
#F 128
#D 7.1 4.5
#S 4.4.5/29/7
#T P01/1 P02/1

SR2.   <Delete all structures> with an open structure causes the structure
to exist as an open, empty structure in the CSS.
#F 128
#D 7.1 4.2 4.5
#S 4.4.5/29/7
#T P02/2 P02/3

PROGRAM 1: Deletion of all closed structures

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: passive test

DESIGN:

Use <open structure> and <execute structure> to set up the CSS
as follows:


               100
               / \
             1/   \2
             /     \
          103       104     102
         / \          \     / \
       1/   \2        1\  1/   \2
       /     \          \ /     \
     105     105        106     109
                        / \     / \
                      1/   \2 1/   \2
                      /     \ /     \
                    107     108     110

The nodes of the graph (100 and above) represent structures, and the
labelled edges are references to invoke (lower) structures.  The
labels (1-2) represent the element position of the <execute structure>
function within the calling structure.

TEST: #SR 1
      "<Delete all structures> should remove all the closed structures
       contained in the CSS."

<delete all structures>

Use <inquire structure identifiers> to determine
    nstid = number of structure identifiers

<inquire structure identifiers> nstid
pass/fail depending on (nstid = 0)

END PROGRAM 1


PROGRAM 2: Deletion of all structures with an open structure

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: passive test

DESIGN:

Use <open structure> and <execute structure> to set up the CSS
as follows:


               100
               / \
             1/   \2
             /     \
          103       104     102
         / \          \     / \
       1/   \2        1\  1/   \2
       /     \          \ /     \
     105     105        106     109
                        / \     / \
                      1/   \2 1/   \2
                      /     \ /     \
                    107     108     110

The nodes of the graph (100 and above) represent structures, and the
labelled edges are references to invoke (lower) structures.  The
labels (1-2) represent the element position of the <execute structure>
function within the calling structure.

TEST: #SR 1
      "<Delete all structures> with an open structure should
       remove all closed structures from the CSS."

strid = 106
<open structure> strid
<delete all structures>

Use <inquire structure identifiers> to determine
    nstid = number of structure identifiers
    nstr  = nth structure identifier

<inquire structure identifiers> nstid, nstr
pass/fail depending on (nstid = 1 and nstr = 106)

TEST: #SR 2
      "<Delete all structures> with an open structure should cause
       that structure to exist in the CSS as an open structure."

use <inquire open structure> to determine
    stype = the structure status open or close
    strref = structure id

if (stype <> open  or
    strid <> strref) then
    fail
else
    pass
    <close structure>
endif

TEST: #SR 2
      "<Delete all structures> with an open structure should cause
       that structure to exist in the CSS as an empty structure."

use <inquire structure status> on strid to determine
    strsti = structure status idenitifier

pass/fail depending on (strsti = empty)
