TITLE: Change structure references

MODULE#: 02.01.03.02

DESCRIPTION:
This module tests the effects of <change structure references> on
structures contained in the CSS.  The state of the CSS is examined
for the changes.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.   <Change structure references> replaces all structure
invocations of original structure with invocations of resulting
structure.
#F 130
#D 7.1 7.3.4
#S 4.4.5/30/1
#T P02/1 P02/2

SR2.   When the original structure is non-existent or not
referenced then <change structure references> causes no changes
within the CSS.
#F 130
#D 7.1 7.3.4
#S 4.4.5/30/1
#T P01/1 P01/2 P01/3

SR3.   When the original and resulting structures are the same
then <change structure references> causes no changes within the
CSS.
#F 130
#D 7.1 7.3.4
#S 4.4.5/30/1
#T P01/4

SR4.   When the resulting structure is referenced then <change
structure references> causes those references to remain as is.
#F 130
#D 7.1 7.3.4
#S 4.4.5/30/1
#T P02/2

SR5.   On all workstations where the resulting structure is
posted, <change structure references> causes the original
structure to be unposted and the resulting structure to remain
posted with unchanged priority.
#F 130
#D 7.2 5.7
#S 4.4.5/30/1
#T P03/1 P03/2
#X 05.03

SR6.   On all workstations where the original structure is posted
and the resulting structure is not posted <change structure
references> causes the original structure to become unposted and
the resulting structure to become posted with the priority of the
original structure.

DESIGN:

The following is the "standard" CSS network for module 02.01.03.  This
CSS network will be used throughout to test the resulting state of the
CSS after execution of the <change structure references> function.
Before each test case the CSS state is completely reset.

PROGRAM 3: The effects of <change structure references> on posted
           structures

CHARACTERISTICS: ynnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: passive test.

DESIGN:

The following is the "standard" CSS network for module 02.01.03.  This
CSS network will be used throughout to test the resulting state of the
CSS after execution of the <change structure references> function.
Before each test case the CSS state is completely reset.
