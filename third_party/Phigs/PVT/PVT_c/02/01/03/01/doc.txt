TITLE: Change structure identifier

MODULE#: 02.01.03.01

DESCRIPTION:
This module tests the effects of changing the identifier of a
structure contained in the CSS.  Changes which occur to the original
structure, the resulting structure and the state of the CSS are
examined.

The following truth table applies when the original and resulting
identifier are different.  The information regarding changes to the
CSS network may be derived from the "Org Cont", "Rst Cont" and
NON-EXIST of the resulting state of the truth table.

INITIAL STATE    Indicates the state of the original and resulting
                 structure before the execution of the <change structure
                 identifier> function.

   NON-EXIST        The original or resulting structure does not
                    exist in the CSS at the time the <change structure
                    identifier> is executed.

   Org or Res Stat  open  The structure is open at the time the <change
                          structure identifier> function is executed.
                    clos  The structure is closed at the time the <change
                          structure identifier> function is executed.

                          structure at the time the <change structure
                          identifier> function is executed.

   Org or Res Post  pst   The structure is posted to some workstation
                          at the time the <change structure identifer>
                          function is executed.

                          at the time the <change structure identifier>
                          function is executed.


RESULTING STATE  Indicates the state of the original and resulting
                 structure after the execution of the <change structure
                 identifier> function.

   NON-EXIST        No structure exists with the original identifier
                    in the CSS after the <change structure identifier>
                    function is executed.

   Org Stat    open  The structure with the original structure
                     identifier is open after the <change structure

               clos  The structure with the original structure
                     identifier is closed after the <change structure
                     identifier> function is executed.

   Org Cont    emp   The structure with the original identifier is
                     empty after the <change structure identifier>
                     function is executed.

   Org Post    pst   The original structure identifier is posted to
                     the same workstation(s) after the <change structure
                     identifer> function is executed as it was before.
               npt   The original structure identifier is not posted to
                     any workstation after the <change structure
                     identifier> function is executed.

                     identifier is open after the <change structure
                     identifier> function is executed.
               clos  The structure with the resulting structure
                     identifier is closed after the <change structure

   Res Cont    org   The contents, if any, of the resulting structure
                     are replaced by the contents of original structure
                     after the <change structure identifier> function
                     is executed.
               emp   The structure with the resulting structure
                     identifier is empty after the <change structure
                     identifer> function is executed.

   Res Post    pst   The resulting structure identifier is posted to
                     the same workstation(s) after the <change structure
                     identifier> function is executed as it was before.
               npt   The resulting structure identifier is not posted
                     to the any workstation after the <change structure
                     identifier> function is executed.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.  When the original and resulting structure identifiers
differ, <change structure identifier> causes the transition from
the initial state to the resulting state as described in the truth
table.

LOCAL SUBROUTINES:  The programs in this module use special-purpose
subroutines:

1. TSTCID performs a test case for the <change structure
identifier> function.  Based on the input parameters, it sets up a
test message, executes the function, examines the result, and
issues pass or fail.

2. ELSTR creates a substring consisting of integer pairs to
represent the contents of a structure.  Within each pair, the
first value indicates the element type (execute structure or
label) and the second value indicates the element content.

3. TCSCID returns a substring used in the formulation of the test
message.  The substring indicates the precondition and expected
postcondition of a particular structure.  The structure can be
non-existent, opened or closed, referenced or not referenced,
posted or not posted, and empty or with the contents of original
structure.

4. ACTST returns the actual state of a structure.  The structure
can be non-existent, opened or closed, posted or not posted, and
empty or with the contents of original structure or some other
contents.

PROGRAM 1: Changing a structure identifier

CHARACTERISTICS: ynnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: passive test.

DESIGN:

The following is the "standard" CSS network for module 02.01.03.  This
CSS network will be used throughout to test the resulting state of the
CSS after execution of the <change structure identifier> function.
Before each test case the CSS state is completely reset.

PROGRAM 2: Changing a structure identifier when the original and
           resulting identifier are the same

CHARACTERISTICS: ynnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: passive test.

DESIGN:

The following is the "standard" CSS network for module 02.01.03.  This
CSS network will be used throughout to test the resulting state of the
CSS after execution of the <change structure identifier> function.
Before each test case the CSS state is completely reset.

PROGRAM 3: Effects of <change structure identifier> on the
           element pointer

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: passive test.

DESIGN:

The following is the "standard" CSS network for module 02.01.03.  This
CSS network will be used throughout to test the resulting state of the
CSS after execution of the <change structure identifier> function.
Before each test case the CSS state is completely reset.

Structure 111 in the CSS is set up as follows:

The nodes on the graph numbered 114 and 115 represent the
structure elements associated with <execute structure>.  The nodes
between (900 and 999) represent the structure elements associated
with <label> .  The arcs (1-11) represent the position of the
<execute structure> or <label> element within the structure.
