TITLE: Inquiring element type and size, and content

MODULE#: 02.03.01

DESCRIPTION: This module tests the inquiry functions dealing with
element type and size, and element content.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.   <Inquire current element type and size> returns the element
type and size of the structure element pointed to by the element
pointer.
#F 303
#D 7.3 4.2 4.3
#S 4.4.4/29/5
#T P02/1 P02/5

SR2.   <Inquire current element type and size>  returns NIL as
the element type and 0 as the element size when the element
pointer is 0.
#F 303
#D 7.3 4.2 4.3
#S 4.4.4/29/5
#T P02/9

SR3.   <Inquire current element content> returns the values of
the structure element data record associated with the structure
element pointed to by the element pointer.

#D 7.3 4.2 4.3
#S 4.4.4/29/5
#T P02/2 P02/6 P02/10
#C The Fortran binding specifies that for the NIL element
(position 0), all array sizes are zero.

SR4.   <Inquire element type and size> returns the element type
and size for the specified element.
#F 305
#D 7.1 7.3
#S 4.4.6/30/4
#T P01/3 P02/3 P02/7

SR5.   <Inquire element type and size> returns NIL as the element
type and 0 as the element size when the specified element position
is 0.
#F 305
#D 7.1 7.3

SR6.   <Inquire element content> returns the values of the
structure element data record associated with the specified
structure element.

Define polyline points
