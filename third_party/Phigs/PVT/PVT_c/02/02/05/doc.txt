TITLE: Copy all elements from structure

MODULE#: 02.02.05

DESCRIPTION: This module tests the ability of the programmer to
copy all elements from a specified structure into an open
structure using the function <copy all elements from structure>.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.   <Copy all elements from structure> copies all elements of a
specified structure into an open structure after the `element
pointer' regardless of the `edit mode.'
#F 118
#D 7.1 7.3 4.3
#S 4.4.4/29/2
#T P01/3 P01/5 P01/7 P01/9

SR2.   If the specified structure in <copy all elements from
structure> is the open structure, its contents are copied into
itself after the `element pointer.'
#F 118
#D 7.1 7.3 4.3
#S 4.4.4/29/2
#T P01/11

SR3.   After <copy all elements from structure>, the `element
pointer' is updated to point to the last element that was copied.

#D 7.3 4.3
#S 4.4.4/29/2
#T P01/4 P01/6 P01/8 P01/10 P01/12

SR4.   If the specified structure in <copy all elements from
structure> is empty or nonexistent, no action takes place.
