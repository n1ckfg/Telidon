TITLE: Opening and closing PHIGS

MODULE#: 01

DESCRIPTION: This module tests the effect of opening and closing
PHIGS on the system state.  Other effects of opening PHIGS,
(initialization of PHIGS Description Table and PHIGS State List)
are tested in the modules which cover the affected data items.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.   <Open PHIGS> sets the system state to open.
#F 1
#D 1.1
#S 4.10/107/2
#T P01/2 P01/4

SR2.   <Close PHIGS> sets the system state to closed.
#F 2
#D 1.1
#S 4.10/107/2
#T P01/3

SR3.   <Inquire system state value> returns the system state of PHIGS.
#F 200
#D 1.1
#S n
#T P01/1 P01/2 P01/3 P01/4

PROGRAM 1: Testing the system state value

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: passive test.

DESIGN:

Use <inquire system state value> to determine:
    systra = system state value

TEST: #SR 3
      "<Inquire system state value> should return closed as the system state
       value before PHIGS is opened."

<inquire system state value> systra
pass/fail depending on (systra = closed)

TEST: #SR 1 3
      "After opening PHIGS <inquire system state value> should return the
       system state value as open."

<open PHIGS>
<inquire system state value> systra
pass/fail depending on (systra = open)

TEST: #SR 2 3
      "After closing PHIGS <inquire system state value> should return the
       system state value as closed."

<close PHIGS>
<inquire system state value> systra
pass/fail depending on (systra = closed)

TEST: #SR 1 3
      "After reopening PHIGS <inquire system state value> should return the
       system state value as open."

<open PHIGS>
<inquire system state value> systra
pass/fail depending on (systra = open)
<close PHIGS>
