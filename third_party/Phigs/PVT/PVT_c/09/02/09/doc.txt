PROGRAM 1: Error indicator = 404

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: passive test

DESIGN:

Call functions 213,214 with an archive file not open to test if they
set number 404 to the error indicator: ignoring function, the specified
structure does not exist.

<inquire all conflicting structures>
TEST: #SR 1
      "If <inquire all conflicting structures> is called and the
       specified archive file is not open, it should return error indicator
       = 404."
pass/fail depending on (returned error indicator = 404)

<inquire conflicting structures in network>
TEST: #SR 1
      "If <inquire conflicting structures in network> is called and the
       specified archive file is not open, it should return error indicator
       = 404."
pass/fail depending on (returned error indicator = 404)

<inquire conflicting structures in network>
TEST: #SR 1
      "If <inquire conflicting structures in network> is called and the
       specified archive file is not open, it should return error indicator
       = 404."
pass/fail depending on (returned error indicator = 404)
