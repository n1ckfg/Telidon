Call function 109 with the projection reference point between the front
and the back planes to test if it sets 162 to error indicator: ignoring
function, the projection reference point is between the front and the back
planes.

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT: passive test

DESIGN:

Call function 109 with the N coordinate of the projection reference point
equal to the view plane distance to test if it sets 163 to error indicator:
ignoring function, the projection reference point cannot be positioned on
the view plane.
