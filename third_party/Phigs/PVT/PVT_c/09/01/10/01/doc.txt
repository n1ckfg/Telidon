TITLE: Fortran-specific errors handled by user

MODULE#: 09.01.10.01

DESCRIPTION: This module tests that the functions which generate error
conditions peculiar to the Fortran binding.  The error is handled by a
user defined error handling subroutine. Also, this module tests the
requirement that no side effects are generated.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.  If functions <redraw all structures>, <update workstation>, <set
display update state>, <set text precision>, <set text path>, <set
text alignment>, <set annotation text path>, <set annotation text
alignment>, <set interior style>, <set edge flag>, <set individual
asf>, <set text representation>, <set interior representation>, <set
edge representation>, <set colour model>, <set local transformation
3>, <set local transformation>, <set modelling clipping indicator>,
<set view representation 3>, <set view representation>, <set view
transformation input priority>, <set edit mode>, <delete structure
network>, <set conflict resolution>, <retrieve paths to ancestors>,
<retrieve paths to decendants>, <initialize choice 3>-<initialize
pick>, <set locator mode>-<set string mode>, <flush device events>,
<set error handling mode> are called, and enumeration type is out of
range, then error 2000 is generated and the function is ignored.

SR2.  If functions <retrieve structure identifiers>, <retrieve paths
to ancesters>, <retrieve paths to descendants>, <get stroke 3>, <get
stroke>, <get pick> are called, and output parameter size is
insufficeint - the FORTRAN array or string being passed as an output
paremeter is too small to contain the returned information, then error
2001 is generated and the function is ignored.

structure networks>, <retrieve structures>, <retrieve structure
networks>, <delete structures from archive>, <delete structure
networks from archive>, <set pick filter>-<initialize string>, <write
item to metafile>, <interpret item> are called, and input parameter
size is out of range - the INTEGER passed as an input parameter
defining the size of FORTRAN array parameters is negative or greater
than an absolute maximum, then error 2004 is generated and the
function is ignored.

PROGRAM 1: Error 2000 handled by user

CHARACTERISTICS: ynnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT:
This is a passive test, but take care to invoke it so as to link
in the standard PVT user-defined error handler.  Since this is
the mode in which the non-error-handling tests are executed, this
program should be invoked in the normal way.

DESIGN:
Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted
by the tag "signals error"), the user-defined error handler saves
the error code, function identifier, and error file identifier in
an error table.
