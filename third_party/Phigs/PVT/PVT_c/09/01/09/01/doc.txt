TITLE: Archive and retrieve errors handled by user

MODULE#: 09.01.09.01

DESCRIPTION: This module tests that the functions which are related
to archive or retrieve generate the specified error codes if they are executed
in an incorrect conditions.  The error is handled by a user defined error
handling subroutine. Also, this module tests the requirement that no side
effects are generated.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.   If function <open archive file> is called, and a specified archive
file cannot be opened, then error 400 is generated and the function is
ignored.
#F 135
#D 9.1 8.1
#S 4.12/109/6
#T

SR2.   If function <open archive file> is called, and openning this
archive file would exceed the maximum number of simultaneously open
archive files, then error 401 is generated and the function is ignored.
#F 135
#D 2.4 9.1 8.1
#S 4.12/109/6
#T P01/1 P01/2

SR3.   If function <open archive file> is called, and the specified
archive file identifier already is in use, then error 402 is generated
and the function is ignored.
#F 135
#D 4.6.2 9.1 8.1
#S 4.12/109/6
#T P02/1 P02/2

SR4.   If function <open archive file> is called, and the archive file
is not a PHIGS archive file, then error 403 is generated and the
function is ignored.
#F 135
#D 9.1 8.1

SR5.   If functions <close archive file> - <archive all structures>,
<retrieve structure identifiers> - <retrieve all structures>,
<delete structures from archive> - <delete all structures from archive>
are called, and the specified archive file is not open,
then error 404 is generated and the function is ignored.

SR6.   If functions <archive structures> - <archive all structures>,
<retrieve structures> - <retrieve all structures> are called, and
name conflict occurs while conflict resolution flag has value ABANDON,
then error 405 is generated and the function is ignored.

SR7.   If functions <archive structures> - <archive all structures>
are called, and the archive file is full, then warning error 406 is
generated and any structures that were archived were archived in total.
#F 137-139
#D 9.1 8.1
#S 4.12/109/6
#T

SR8.   If functions <delete structures from archive>, <delete structure
networks from archive> are called, and some of the specified structures
do not exist on the archive file, then warning error 407 is generated.

#D 9.1 9.1.1 8.1
#S 4.12/109/6
#T P05/1 P05/2 P05/3

SR9.   If functions <retrieve structures>, <retrive structure networks>
are called, and some of the specified structures do not exist on the

empty structure in the place.

PROGRAM 1: Error 401 handled by user

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT:
This is a passive test, but take care to invoke it so as to link
in the standard PVT user-defined error handler.  Since this is
the mode in which the non-error-handling tests are executed, this
program should be invoked in the normal way.

DESIGN:
Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted
by the tag "signals error"), the user-defined error handler saves
the error code, function identifier, and error file identifier in
an error table.

Use <inquire phigs facilities> to get maximum number of simultaneously
open archive files, open maximum number of archive files. Then open one
more archive file to test if function 135 generates error 401: ignoring
function, opening this archive file would exceed the maximum number of
simultanously open archive files.

*** *** ***  Generate errors; test absence of side effects  *** *** ***

Use <inquire phigs facilities> to get:
    maxarf = maximum number of simultaneously open archive files
for ix = 1, maxarf
    <open archive file> with archive file id = ix
next ix
<open archive file> with archive file id = maxarf+1: signals error
use <inquire archive files> to get :
    numarf = number of archive files
TEST: #SR 2
      "If <open archive file> signals an error because opening this archive
       file would exceed the maximum number of simultaneously open archive
       files, it should not cause any other effect."
pass/fail depending on (system state = PHIGS-open and
                        archive state = open and
                        numarf = maxarf)

for ix = 1, maxarf
    <close archive file> with ix
next ix

*** *** ***  Results of user-defined error handling  *** *** ***

TEST: #SR 2
      "If <open archive file> is called and opening this archive file
       would exceed the maximum number of simultaneously open archive
       files, it should return error code  401, function
       identifier  114, and the current error file identifier to the user
       defined error handler."

PROGRAM 2: Error 402 handled by user

DESIGN:
Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted
by the tag "signals error"), the user-defined error handler saves
the error code, function identifier, and error file identifier in
an error table.

Open one archive file first, then open another archive file with the same
identifier as first one to test if function 135 generates error 402: ignoring
function, archive file identifier already in use.

PROGRAM 3: Error 404 handled by user

CHARACTERISTICS: nnnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT:
See OPERATOR SCRIPT for Program 1.

DESIGN:
Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted
by the tag "signals error"), the user-defined error handler saves
the error code, function identifier, and error file identifier in
an error table.

Not open any archive file to test if functions 136,137,141,142,144,147
generates error 404 and/or 7; open one archive file with archive file
identifier arid, call functions 138,139,143,148,149 with archive file
identifier other than arid to test  if those functions generate error 404
and/or 7: ignoring function, the specified archive file is not open.
