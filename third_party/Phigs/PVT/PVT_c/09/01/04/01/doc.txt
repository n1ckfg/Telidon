TITLE: Transformation and viewing errors handled by user

MODULE#: 09.01.04.01

DESCRIPTION: This module tests that the functions which are related
to workstation transformation and viewing generate the specified
error codes if they are executed in an incorrect condition.  The error is
handled by a user defined error handling subroutine. Also, this module tests
the requirement that no side effects are generated.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.  If functions <set view representation 3>, <set view
representation> are called, and setting this view table entry would
exceed the maximum number of entries allowed in the workstation view
table, then error 150 is generated and the function is ignored.

window> are called, and the specified workstation limits are invalid:
XMIN>=XMAX, YMIN>=YMAX, ZMIN>=ZMAX, UMIN>=UMAX, or VMIN>=VMAX, then
error 151 is generated and the function is ignored.

are invalid: XMIN>=XMAX, YMIN>=YMAX, or ZMIN>=ZMAX, then error 152 is
generated and the function is ignored.

representation> are called, and the specified view clipping limits are
invalid: XMIN>=XMAX, YMIN>=YMAX, or ZMIN>=ZMAX, then error 153 is

PROGRAM 1: Error 150 handled by user

CHARACTERISTICS: ynnn

OPERATOR SCRIPT:
This is a passive test, but take care to invoke it so as to link
in the standard PVT user-defined error handler.  Since this is
the mode in which the non-error-handling tests are executed, this
program should be invoked in the normal way.


DESIGN:
Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted
by the tag "signals error"), the user-defined error handler saves
the error code, function identifier, and error file identifier in
an error table.

First, setting view representations for maximum number allowed on the
workstation view table, then set one more view representation or view
representation 3 to test if functions 83,84 generates error 150 :ignoring
function, setting view table entry would exceed the maximum number of entries
allowed in the workstation view table.

*** *** ***  Generate errors; test absence of side effects  *** *** ***

<open workstation> wkid

Use <inquire workstation state table lengths> to determine:
   maxvw = maximum number of view table indices
rotmt3(3,3) = identity matrix

clplm3 = {0.,1.,0.,1.}
rotmap(4,4) = identity matrix
mapmat(4,4) = identity matrix
clplm4 = (0.,1.,0.,1.,0.,1.}

for ix = 1 to maxvw
   <set view representation> with index=ix, rotmat,mapmat,clplim,clip
next ix
<set view representation> with index=maxvw+1,rotmat,mapmat,clplim,clip:
   signals error
use <inquire list of view indices> to get:
   nvwix = number of view bundle table intries
TEST: #SR 1
      "If <set view representation> signals an error because setting this
       view table entry would exceed the maximum number of entries allowed
       in the workstation view table, it should not cause any other effect."

Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted

the error code, function identifier, and error file identifier in
an error table.

Setting view clipping limits to the values out of NPC range to test if
functions 83,84 generate error 154: ignoring function, the view clipping
limits are not within NPC range.
