TITLE: Structure errors handled by system

MODULE#: 09.01.05.02

DESCRIPTION: This module tests that the functions which are related
to structures generate the specified error codes if they are executed
in an incorrect conditions.  The error is handled by the default system
handling subroutine. Also, this module tests the requirement that no
side effects.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.   If functions <archive structures>, <archive structure networks>
are called, and a specified structure does not exist in the CSS,
then a warning error 200 is generated and no action is taken for that
structure.

#D 4.5 4.5.1 9.1 8.1
#S 4.12/109/6
#T P01/1 P01/2 P01/3 P01/4 P01/5 P01/6 P01/7 P01/8

SR2.   If functions <retrieve paths to ancestors> , <retrieve paths to
descendants > are called, and the specified structure does not
exist, then error 201 is generated and the function is ignored.

#D 9.1 9.1.1 9.1.2 8.1
#S 4.12/109/6
#T P02/1 P02/2 P02/3 P02/4

SR3.   If function <set element pointer at label> is called, and the
lable does not exist in the open structure between the element pointer
and the end of the structure, then error 205 is generated and the function
is ignored.

#S 4.12/109/6
#T P03/1 P03/2 P03/3

SR4.   If function <delete elements between labels> is called, and one
or both of the labels does not exist in the open structure between the element
pointer and the end of the structure, then error 206 is generated and the
function is ignored.
#F 124

SR5.   If functions <retrieve paths to ancestors>, <retrieve paths to
descendants> are called, and the specified path depth is less than zero,
then error 207 is generated and the function is ignored.

#D 9.1 9.1.1 9.1.2 8.1
#S 4.12/109/6
#T P05/1 P05/2 P05/3 P05/4

SR6.   If function <post structure> is called, and the display priority
is out of range, then error 208 is generated and the function is ignored.

PROGRAM 1: Error 200 handled by system

CHARACTERISTICS: nnny

OPERATOR SCRIPT:
This program uses the system default error handler.  The usual
means of invoking PVT programs links in a user-defined error handler.
Be sure to use the special mechanism provided (normally the "phfe" or
"phce" command) for invoking programs without the user-defined error
handler, since it overrides the system handler.

The general idea of this test is that errors are generated and the
resulting error messages from the system default error handler are
displayed so that you can verify their contents.

The program needs to display the contents of the error file one message at
a time .  If the system has a consistent message header (as specified to
INITPH), this is done automatically.  If not, you are prompted to say
whether the entire message has been displayed, since one message may occupy
several records.  The program will keep displaying successive records
until the entire message is visible.

Once the entire error message is displayed, you must enter the function
that  generated the corresponding error as reported in the message.  You
may identify the function either by its full generic name ("polyline 3"),
or by its unique number as specified in Fortran and C bindings (these are
the same). E.g. instead of typing "polyline 3", you can enter "8".  If the
message does not identify the function, enter a negative number to signify
this.

The error message may  or may not specify the numeric code of the error.
If so, simply enter the code as prompted.  If not, enter "n".  The program
will then display the standard wording for the error (there may be several
possible wordings, since a given condition may sometimes generate one of
several errors).  If the actual message is accurate with respect to the
standard wording (has the same meaning), enter "y", otherwise "n".

DESIGN:
Throughout this program, every time an error is signalled (as noted
by the tag "signals error"), the system-defined error handler should
call <error logging> to write in error message on the error file.

<archive structures> or <archive structure networks> using one
structure which does not exist in CSS to test if warning error
200 is generated: ignoring structures that do not exist.
