Addenda to PVT documentation
----------------------------

These notes reflect additions and changes to version 2.1 of the PVT.
The resulting version is 2.2.

In LAYER/ninst.c, there may be implementor-defined initialization.
The code is correct as far as it goes, but implementors are free
to enhance it as needed by the implementation.  This is a
consequence of the standard leaving Pstring_data (partially)
implementation-dependent. The PVT documentation should reflect
this in the future, probably in the User Guide, section 3.2.  The
problem is that the PHIGS/C standard (see p. 35) does not define
any fields within the record except in_buf_size and init_pos,
which is already filled in.

In c/LAYER nqcets.c, nqceco.c, nqets.c, and nqeco.c there may be
implementor-defined setting of sl (dimension of string array) and str
returned for the gdp and gdp3 primitive.  Since the answer depends on
the data returned by pinq_cur_elem_content and since the format
(Pgdp_data and Pgdp3_data) are implementation-defined, the equivalent
sl is not computable in a standard way.

Changed c/F2C/f2c.h to make integer equivalent to int, instead of long
int, but this is user-modifiable.  Users may need to change the
typedef declaration of the named types in f2c.h (such as "logical" and
"integer") to be compatible with their systems.  E.g. the default
typedef assumes that Fortran's "integer" = C's "int".

In general, more methodical labelling of changeable source code:

USERMOD: Code which may legally be changed by individual users of the
PVT, including PHIGS implementors.  All user-modifiable code is marked
with "USERMOD" in both Fortran and C for easier identification.
Suggest doing: "grep USERMOD *.c" or "grep USERMOD *.f" in PVT root
and V2LIB to get all possible places code may be modified.

MANUAL: C code which has to be manually altered by NIST, folowing
automatic generation of C from Fortran.

SUNCODE: Code which has been changed to a non-standard form in order
to run on SunPHIGS.  This should be only in the work subtree, not the
std subtree.
