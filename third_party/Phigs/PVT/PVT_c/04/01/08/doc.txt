TITLE: Generalized drawing primitive

MODULE#: 04.01.08

DESCRIPTION: This module tests the ability of the programmer to
set up a generalized drawing primitive element in the CSS, which
will create a primitive upon traversal.

SEMANTIC REQUIREMENTS:

SR1.   <Generalized drawing primitive 3> creates a generalized
drawing primitive 3 element in the CSS; the element is created
even if the GDP 3 primitive is not supported by the implementation.

    celsiz = current element size

Use <inquire current element content> throughout to determine:
    celcon = current element content
