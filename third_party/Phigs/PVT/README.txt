README file for PVT subdirectory of anonymous FTP
-------------------------------------------------

1999-sep-20

This subdirectory contains files related to the PHIGS Validation Tests
(PVT) developed by NIST.  These tests are freely available to the
public and are not subject to copyright.  No warranty is expressed or
implied as to their correctness.

Files starting with "valid" are validation summary reports (VSRs)
for those implementations which have been through the official
NIST testing process.

Those who want their own copy of the PVT should FTP it from this
directory.  File sizes, in megabytes:

               |   Fortran           C
               |   PVT_fort.tar.Z    PVT_c.tar.Z
---------------+-----------------------------------
compressed     |   2.5               3.6 
uncompressed   |   8.7              13.2 

Of course this is the size of the documentation and source code only;
if you compile the code on your machine, the executables will take up
more space.

The version available as of September 1999 is version 2.2.  This contains
no additional tests relative to version 2.1, but many coding errors
were corrected.

A paper discussing the design strategy that governed the development
of the PVT is available in Postscript format, under the obvious
filename.

Those who wish simply to browse through the tests using WWW should
open URL =

  http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/vvrg/cugini/pvt/hy-top.html

and proceed from there.  Although this version is slightly out of date
(and in Fortran only), it is easier to navigate than the raw files.

We request that anyone using the PVT system register with NIST, so
that we can know about the extent of usage and also notify people of
changes, updates, and corrections.  Please mail information and/or
direct questions and comments to:
