	<b><a href="https://github.com/n1ckfg/Telidon/blob/master/js/telidon/TelidonP5.js">TelidonP5.js</a></b> allows NAPLPS vector graphics files to be displayed in a browser using <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. Its companion decoder library <b><a href="https://github.com/n1ckfg/Telidon/blob/master/js/telidon/naplps-decoder.js">naplps-decoder.js</a></b> can also be used independently.<br/>

	August 15th, 2018 is the 40th anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telidon">Telidon</a> graphics format, created in 1978. The Telidon hardware was discontinued in 1985, but a variant of the format, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLPS">NAPLPS</a>, thrived and remained in wide use throughout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a> era, until the early 1990s. Thanks to its exceptionally small file size and limited animation features, it can be seen as a technological ancestor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF#Animated_GIF">animated GIF</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWF">Flash SWF</a>&mdash;a medium that allowed new types of work to be both produced and consumed on the same machine.

<p>
	From 1982&ndash;1985, members of the Toronto arts org <a href="http://interaccess.org/">InterAccess</a> used Telidon systems to produce an ambitious series of <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezveak/the-original-net-artists">interactive BBS-based artworks</a> in the format.
