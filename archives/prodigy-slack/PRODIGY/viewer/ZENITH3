ɾܣܾܷĳWith a built-in Ethernet-compatible
port and pre-installed network client
software, the Z-NOTE is the only
PC-compatible notebook with built-in
networking. The READYDESK   port
replicator lets you permanently hook
up to home or office cables. BYTE
says its screen is "the best among
 laptops...bright with extremely good
 contrast." And in PC WORLD tests,
 the Z-NOTE's battery outlasted the
 nearest competitor by over an
 hour. 渤TMɢ鸤Z-SPORT [NEXT]Z-SPORT [NEXT]أ·ɾ긤325L325SZ-62OnlDesktops/Special OfferУȷ¾ũɾȣĤܣɾȤؤ˩Ȥ֩ѩ¾өɾȣĤʩܤҩ֩Ⱦĳšɾܣ̩ȡȳɾܤġȲ֡ȤЩȡܤȩŦʤĩܤؤؾгϳȾȤ̳ؤءɾȣөөؤéСܸlոl l  l  lllll lžТҸLɾܤéȤȤݩȾȤ۩ȾȢLѸLѸLѸLѸLѸLѾܯȷܣķǾȷķȣķܣķǾȷƾܣɡɢ޸TMơۤ۾ܢTheZ NOTEۥ
