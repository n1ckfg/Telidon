ɾУĳ  The soft grip steering wheel feels thick
and comfortable in your hand. It's just one

engineering based on human feelings.
  In the center pad of the steering wheel
is an airbag--a Supplemental Restraint System.
That's a pretty sophisticated standard
feature for a car this inexpensive.ȣ˾ܸ>[ESC]ҾԩǡɾܣķУס踤QFɾ˥
